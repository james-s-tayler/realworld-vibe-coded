## Phase Analysis

<!--
FlowPilot parsing rules (v1):

- A phase starts with "### phase_<number>"
- The number defines ordering
- Sections under each phase:
    - **Goal**: <text>
    - **Key Outcomes**: list of "* outcome"
    - **Working State Transition**: <text>

The linter and next-command can rely on these headings exactly.
